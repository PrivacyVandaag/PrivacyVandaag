## Summary
Privacy Vandaag is a light, modern, totally free (no ads) and opensource project which keeps you informed 
about developments on the privacy front in The Netherlands. The app follows actively four privacy organisations 
and notifies the user when new articles are published by those organisations. The articles are fetched and displayed 
in a mobile-optimized way. The project is based on the SpaRSS and Flym RSS reader.

The app is not distributed through Google App store, therefore it features its own update functionality including the possibility of service message.

## Features
* immediately ready-for-use after installation. No tweaking necessary, all elements are included in the app.
* easily follow or unfollow imbedded feeds of the privacy organisations
* customize your notifications.
* switch between light or dark theme
* easy update if a new version of the app becomes available. User is notified through a service message.
* offline reading including images
* retrieve the full text of the feed when the content is truncated
* star your favorite entries
* search through your articles
